# MCScanx-python-wrapper
This is a python wrapper for running MCScanx

[MCScanX](https://github.com/wyp1125/MCScanX) is an amazing tool for identifying and visualyzing syntenic blocks between two or more genomes.
Unfortunately, the first time I ran it I had a lot of issues, and the manual is not the best. So I decided to create this python wrapper.


##Befor running the wrapper, the following tools must be installed and available in the path:

```
blastp (and makeblastdb)
python 3 or higher (tested on 3.8.12)
Biopython
```
Now you're ready to run it!
